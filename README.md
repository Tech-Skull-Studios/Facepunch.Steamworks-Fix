# Facepunch.Steamworks-Fix
I rebuilt the DLL files to use Steamworks SDK 1.57

Replace the files in Assemblies and redistributable_bin wherever they are in your project. This will fix the 
'Unable to find an entry point named 'SteamAPI_SteamInput_v001' in DLL 'steam_api64'
error and update the libraries to SDK 1.57
